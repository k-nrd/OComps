# OComps

Is an archetypal ECS library.

It tries to be a reasonably simple implementation, but still performant.

Goals:
- Exceptional ergonomics (we might use some ppx magic here, but we'll try to make it reasonably transparent)
- Simple codebase (so advanced users can copy-paste our stuff and hack on it to their heart's desire)
- Decent performance (same ballpark of average Rust/C++ implementations, hopefully)
