# OComps

Is a performant and easy to understand archetypal ECS library.

Goals:
- Exceptional ergonomics (might use some ppx magic, but we'll try to make it reasonably transparent)
- Simple codebase (advanced users can copy-paste our stuff and hack on it to their heart's desire)
- Decent performance (ballpark of average Rust/C++ implementations, hopefully)
